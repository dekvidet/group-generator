# GroupGenerator

Group Generator lets you upload a CSV file (from Excel, Google Spreadsheets, Google Forms, etc) containing a list of participants and generate groups on dinamic rules like group size, gender diversity, prefered age ranges, group leaders, etc. The results can be viewed as tables or exported to XLS to create a printable list.
